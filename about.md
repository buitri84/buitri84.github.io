title: About
---

In my previous life, I had been an investment analyst (buy side), management consultant (McKinsey), MBA graduate (Michigan Ross), and product leader in fintech and edutech. I am a perennial student, in the sense that I always feel I could do more learning - both the fundamentals of the known and the temptation of the unknown. It also means that I have perhaps a few too many degrees to list here.

This page is where I:

- Transfer my knowledge in GMAT / GRE / SAT / AP (Maths and Computer Science) to help students achieve their goals
- Keep my learning notes in whatever subject it is I'm learning
- Keep my blog - or rather express my thoughts as an independent thinker / tutor / analyst in Vietnam
