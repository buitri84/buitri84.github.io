## Reading Escaping Emotional Entrapments

### Part 2: further happenings and actually exposing my thought patterns

During this previous weekend, there was yet another violent outburst, this time with my own mother and later with my father.

During the previous few days, I was feeling resentment and bottled up frustration because each time my mother told us to do something (usually having to to with Ớt being ill), all I felt was that she was overly controlling, had no respect for our capacity to handle any situation or make our own judgement, and just simply annoying. Anything she said sounded too negative and doom saying to me. And probably just her energy was too negative and anxious for my liking. 

Monday morning, I told her to go to the hospital with us (for taking Ớt to see the doctors). I didn't say it too nicely or positively. I said something like: đi cùng bọn con để bác sĩ có nói gì thì biết, khỏi lại về thuật lại rồi lại nói này nói nọ...
What followed quickly escalated into a verbal shit show. I can't remember the exact words, but certainly:
- She accused us (implying myself and Lan Anh involved) of disrespecting her
- I quickly shouted at her many times because I simply could not hold it. I felt that she never bothers to actually listen to anything I had to say. 
(*aside from writing this, all that runs in my head is how lazy, non-contributing and useless Lan Anh is as a person in the family*)
- I cursed (chửi bậy), not at her (definitely not intentionally) but in front of her. 

Fuck all this narrating is taking too long. Let's get to the point:
- Whenever my parents talk to me (or talk back at me), pretty much on anything now, I immediately get into defensive or even worse fight (survival) mode. 
- Anything or any agenda they convey becomes, in my head: con phải làm theo ý bố mẹ vì con không nghe lời cha mẹ là con hư (tự động. Họ luôn khẳng đinh rằng con thì phải nghe lời cha mẹ). Con phải làm theo bố mẹ vì bố mẹ biết điều gì tốt nhất cho con và mọi người.
- With my mom, I think she's actually vulnerable, now that I think about it. She does want "the best" for me or so. But it's her energy, full of anxiety, negative projections about other people (mostly negative), and the pattern of criticizing (downplaying) other people's course of action that weigh on me. Ví dụ: cùng làm 1 thứ, nhưng mình tự làm thì bà nói là làm không đúng, sẽ hỏng vv... còn tới lúc bà làm thì cũng tự phát nhưng xong thì tự ngồi khen là do mình làm đúng.
- With my dad, its: again bố mẹ luôn muốn điều tốt nhất cho con + để làm được điều đó thì chỉ có cách của bố mẹ là đúng. Tệ hơn là ông tin rất chắc chắn vào cả ý tốt, sự đúng đắn về cả tâm ý lẫn cách làm của ông. 
- But apparently, those are the behaviours and patterns and actions coming from my parents, spewing from their beliefs. But the source of pain is obviously that I expect something else completely from them. Add to that yet another competing variable who is Lan Anh, who again has her set of beliefs **and agenda**, and it's no wonder that my current instinctive reactions are:
    - Anger and resentment at people for affecting me, for trying to influence their agenda on me, and also for not giving me what I want (my agenda)
    - Avoidance of pain by simply refusing to act as mediator / intermediaries when each of them voice up their agenda. I simply refuse to engage (which could probably be the best strategy anyway, I'm not sure yet)
    - Following from the point above: on my own, I could desensitize myself and resolve to "not engage" with any of them the moment any agenda is pushed. I could basically let them fight things out instead of influencing me. But that, at the time of this writing, seems to be only a half-baked solution. Is that a good strategy or is it just pain avoidance? It is in my interest to understand deeper the nature of family strife to figure what the best course of action for myself is.

*Understanding -> empathy -> resolution*

- My parents do love me. But they are also saddled by their own humanity. They have expectations, limiting beliefs, insecurities, lack of knowledge, and sometimes personal agenda. The same more or less goes for my wife.
- *There is no point trying to have explanation & conversation & such with them, because 1 key problem is that they have their own limiting beliefs and can't hear my point at all* => is this actually my limiting belief? It surely has some truth to it because I was disappointed trying to talk to them. But they must have been similarly disappointed trying to talk to me. How do I tactfully get what I want?
    - Clearly anger doesn't help!
    - Quiet insistence: probably at least better
    - Start from a position of self interest and love: self interest means the end goal is my autonomy and fulfillment (not short term convenience). Love means I keep in mind that they are just human and are fallible, and try to accommodate them whenever I can (but I do not in anyway have to). Speak clearly and don't expect much. In all cases express clear intention but no anger. When angry, walk away and let it diffuse.
