## Reading Escaping Emotional Entrapments

### Part 1: the trigger event and the first read
I got into another ourburst of anger and resentment today. The trigger was my mother suddenly announcing that she is flying to HCM and suggesting that bà Huong take a break and go back to Dak Lak for a few weeks or so.
I was frustrated and felt immobile (did not think that I would have a solution) with that decision. With the fact that she simply just decided to come without informing early or even consulting us. Also, she either deliberately or unconciously downplayed any inconvenience (khó xử) caused by the action. I could somewhat understand her position as well. She wants to insist on the tone that it is her house and she should be able to carry on her action as best makes sense to her.
I felt frustration and resignment (bực tức, bất lực) from her action.
But what really blew it up was LA's words when I talked to her. Again she cried and complained that there is no respect and that her mom is not con ở and blah blah. I could tell 2 things immediately got into my head:
- She cries and it signifies that she thinks it's unfair to her. That she's being disadvantaged unfairly. Nó khóc ngay lập tức là bù lu như thể ai làm gì tệ lắm với nó và không công bằng.
- She is selfish. Because she immediately focuses on what is convenient for her and chooses to ignore the whole context at large. She immediately blames us. Nó ích kỉ và chỉ lo cái gì hơn thiệt cho nó và mẹ nó. 

Viết xuống để thấy ngay được rằng: nó xấu tính là việc của nó, nó không tử tế và so đo thiệt hơn cũng là việc của nó. Lại câu chuyện muôn thưở là mình điên vì somehow mình lại nghĩ là nó phải không được nhỏ mọn thế. Hay nói cách khác, mình quan tâm là mình xứng đáng có được người vợ KHÔNG nhỏ mọn, hay nói cách khác là thực ra mình không quan tâm nó như thế nào mà quan trọng hơn là nó như thế nào là tốt cho mình. My self interest. The truth is I could care less about her, but I expect highly of her because she's my wife and I hope to have a better wife than displayed. But to be exact: I hope to see a better behaviourial pattern than displayed.
**So is the solution really 100% with me? In that I simply shouldn't expect anything, accept the fact that she can behave that small mindedly?**
Looks like there's no other way, when I come to think of it...
If she needs to be a perfect person for me to not blow up, then it is an impossibility. It means I think I deserve an impossibility, which means I am just being too grandiose. The "should" is too extreme here.
That doesn't solve the part on HOW to maintain any kind of love to her though. But that's for another session.

###Part 2: unfolding of events and second reading
So even though my mom and I had agreed that she would stay just a few days and then leave, when she started asking ba Huong to please sleep in the big room at night, ba Huong basically just state that my mom should stay for a whole week and that she will go to Dak Lak anyway.
This morning, by the time I talked to ba Huong, she already put it as an apparent truth that my mom will stay the whole week (and that's the reason why she needs to go back). I witnessed how people can be as well. An event happens and each of us interprets it in our own way and view the interpretation as the truth.
Furthermore, when I came home I immediately told my mom to sleep in another room (to leave the big room for ba Huong) and that surely hurt her feelings a bit.
And the wife basically just cried the whole night during all of that. 
So I guess this is why writing can be therapeutic. You have all these emotions, strong expletive adjectives in your head, things (abusive) you'd like to tell someone. The thoughts are like monkeys dancing in your head. Then all you do is write down what happened, what you thought and how you felt, and that's it ... there's nothing left to write about. The thoughts and feelings dissipate. There's no need to elaborate or even find any resolutions or strategies. You look at it, describe it, and it dissipates, dissolves, like a puff of smoke.
