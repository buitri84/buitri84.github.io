## Making sense of what's happening in AI:

### The motivation
I missed the first bandwagon on ChatGPT. Right now I'm still trying to register for an account and it's unlikely I can. However, it does serve as a wake-up call on the recent development in AI.
What I've realized are:

- ChatGPT is the application layer. It is such a good (albeit expensive, computationally) product that it has broken through to the mass users.
- Then, it's important to understand what are the infrastructure layers behind it
- I've been apathetic about AI because around me, people keep talking about AI as a product. Or at least that's the level of understanding that I've been stuck on. Now I understand: AI is infrastructure, not product.
- So what ChatGPT shows is a stunning example of what neural network and language model (AI infra and methodology) + extreme computational power can enable what kind of product you can develop.

### TODO
Below are some of the things to understand a little bit more about in order to grasp the true and false implications on ChatGPT:

- [ ] Language models. The real underlying model of things like CHatGPT. Example: LaMBDA, PaLM, OPT-175B, Project Turing.
- [ ] Traditional -> Generative AI -> what else? ChatGPT shows the best example of the neural network / huge data paradigm. Are there equivalent examples of other paradigms? What are the pros and cons?
- [ ] All of this is computationally so intensive that only the mega companies have the resource to really work on: Microsoft, Meta, Google, Deepmind etc... So what's the implication for a place like VN? If the West is building all the infra, will we end up just paying to use their infra to build our local products?
- [ ] Can I access any of these API (instead of signing up for the finished product which seems hopeless by now)? [Like this one](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api)

### Application level implications
There are already many applications using generative-level AI, details in the image(s) below. Of note are music and content creation, also coding tools etc...

Then there's [AI to detect AI](https://openai.com/blog/new-ai-classifier-for-indicating-ai-written-text/). For a tutor, how will this change our jobs if students can now rely on AI to provide essay templates, even ask GMAT questions etc..?

### Reflection:
- So sánh bài cá nhân mình viết với bài ChatGPT generate trên prompt: đánh hơi được hay không dựa vào trình độ chuyên môn / năng lực và cố gắng của ngừoi đọc. There are levels to this.
- The implication on the most obvious subjects: the students and the evaluator: this raises pressure on both sides. The evaluator needs to up his skillset, tools and ability. The student needs to compete with more foes, some invisible and the sense of fairness will be challenged.
- Detour: the value of writing. The result is the result, the tip of the ice berg. But the value of writings lays mostly elsewhere. It is the training to force you to elucidate your thoughts.
- This starts as an observation about a technical tool, but ultimately the key points are about social and political implications. On the application level: the added layer of pressure on students and educators; on the societal level: the question on fairness and equality: between those who have access and who don't, between the groups under and over-represented in the data. 
- Side note: as with statistical models, the data is a hugely important part. Now we have this forever sliding slope between the US / West and the less developed countries: data -> bias -> methodology -> infrastructure -> usage of this infrastructure.
